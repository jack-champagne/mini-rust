# Mini - Rust

This repository is meant to be a collection of mini/larger (maybe) rust projects of my own. I have gotten to a point in the book where I believe more project based learning is required to learn some of the finer things about Rust.

For now, this repository will remain mostly empty. But will in the future be filled with the projects as desribed in the projects on the rust website as well as other misc. things. I remember a few months ago when I had tried solving a simple string manipulation problem in Rust and realized where my knowledge of actual use was limiting me.
